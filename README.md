# Door phone system

The First implementation of Door phone system was done in 2013, as contract project. But I lost my all source code. 

The project was implemented using the following technologies:

* PhoneGap/Cordova, + Cordova plugins for communication
* Javascript and HTML/CSS
* SIP Droid
* Android OS

This project is a complete new implementation which uses a WebRTC.

* serverless webrtc using long poll 
* vp9
* HTML5
* Polymer.js
* ...
